# Advanced-Tableau-skills-for-healthcare-analytics

This project focused on developing advanced Tableau skills for healthcare analytics by creating an interactive dashboard. Key techniques included data blending (combining patient- and hospital-level datasets via Provider ID), Level of Detail (LOD) expressions for consistent calculations across granularities, and interactive controls (parameters, filters).

🔍 Key Learnings

Data blending enabled multi-angle analysis of patient outcomes (readmission, mortality) and hospital attributes (ownership, services, geography).

LOD expressions (e.g., FIXED) ensured fair, filter-independent comparisons of safety scores, readmission, and mortality rates.

Interactive dashboard design improved usability and data storytelling, essential in healthcare decision-making.

📊 Insights

Positive correlation between timeliness of care and hospital ratings, highlighting operational efficiency’s role in patient satisfaction.

Ownership-type disparities in safety scores, with implications for funding and oversight.

Forecasting trends provided a forward-looking view to support planning and resource allocation.

🎯 Impact

The dashboard serves as a prototype for healthcare decision support, translating complex data into actionable insights. It demonstrates how visualization, interactivity, and advanced analytics can bridge the gap between raw information and strategic impact.
